# Anaerobic-Digestion-Models

This repository contains the different versions of the IWA Anaerobic Digetion Model No 1 (ADM1) developed between [Lund University](https://www.iea.lth.se/) and [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.kt.dtu.dk/english/research/prosys). Different implementations are currently available 

<strong>1. Default Matlab/Simulink ADM1 </strong>  

The Main developers are: [Xavier Flores-Alsina](https://github.com/xfalsina), Christian Rosen, Darko Vrecko, Krist V. Gernaey, Marie Noelle Pons and [Ulf Jeppsson](https://github.com/ulfjeppsson). The model is described in the following paper: [Implementing ADM1 for plant-wide benchmark simulations in Matlab/Simulink](https://doi.org/10.2166/wst.2006.521). This version of the model is adapated to be run in Matlab 2019b.

<strong>2. Default Matlab/Simulink ADM1 with algebraic solutions for H2 and pH </strong>  

The Main developers are: [Xavier Flores-Alsina](https://github.com/xfalsina), Christian Rosen, Darko Vrecko, Krist V. Gernaey, Marie Noelle Pons and [Ulf Jeppsson](https://github.com/ulfjeppsson). The model is described in the following paper: [Implementing ADM1 for plant-wide benchmark simulations in Matlab/Simulink](https://doi.org/10.2166/wst.2006.521). This version of the model is adapated to be run in Matlab 2019b.



<strong>3. Default Matlab/Simulink ADM1 with ionic corrections </strong>  

The Main developers are: Kimberly Solon, [Xavier Flores-Alsina](https://github.com/xfalsina),  Christian Kazadi Mbamba, Eveline I.P. Volcke, Stephan Tait, Damien Batstone, Krist Gernaey, and [Ulf Jeppsson](https://github.com/ulfjeppsson). The model is described in the following paper: [Effects of ionic strength and ion pairing on (plant-wide) modelling of anaerobic digestion](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2014.11.035). This version of the model is adapated to be run in Matlab 2019b.
